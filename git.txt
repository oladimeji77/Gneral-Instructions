---------------CREATING A NEW REPOSITORY
First create a new repository in github, then

Run the following in the terminal of your local computer.

- git init 
(creates local git storage).

- git add README.md or git add . (to move every item in the folder)
(adds a README file to your local storage).

- git commit -m "first commit" -
(First commit to your local Storage).

- git branch -M <branch name> 
(creates your first branch "main", it can be any other branch name of your choice).

- git remote add <remote name> <url> 
(remotes or connects to github. The "remote name" can be any name of choice, and the url is provided by git hub when you create the repository).
e.g git remote add origin https://github.com/zimesfield/training.git

- git push -u <remote name> <branch name>
(push branch to remote repository)
e.g git push origin main
